                    We are living in the most exciting time in the history of mankind. The last century has seen unprecedented improvements in the quality of the human condition and technology is at the heart of this progress. Now we are experiencing an even bigger leap as we move towards a new level of digitalization and automation. Ranging from self-driving cars to factories without workers to societal infrastructure, every sensor and actuator is becoming connected and new applications that enable new opportunities are appearing daily. The fuel of this emerging connected, software-driven reality is software and the key challenge is to continuously deliver value to customers. The future of software engineering in this context is centered around a new, emerging digital business operating system consisting of four dimensions: Speed, Data, Ecosystems and Empowerment. The focus on speed is concerned with the constantly increasing rate of deploying new software in the field. This continuous integration and deployment is no longer only the purview of internet companies but is also increasingly deployed in embedded systems. Second, data is concerned with the vast amounts of information collected from systems deployed in the field and the behavior of the users of these systems. Software businesses need to significantly improve their ability to exploit the value present in that data. Third, ecosystems are concerned with the transition in many companies from doing everything in-house to strategic use of innovation partners and commodity providing partners. Finally, we need new ways of organizing work in this new, digital age. The keynote discusses these four main developments but focuses on the continuous software engineering. Also, the keynote provides numerous examples from the Nordic and international industry and predicts the next steps that industry and academia need to engage in to remain competitive.

                    Dr. Elmar Juergens works both as a researcher and a founder. Elmar wrote
                    his PhD thesis on clone detection and is still active as a researcher in software
                    quality analysis. In 2009, he co-founded CQSE GmbH and since helps teams
                    in using analysis tools effectively and in implementing organizational change.<br>
                    Elmar sometimes talks at research conferences (e.g. ICSE, ICPC) and frequently
                    at industry events (50+ talks since 2012). Elmar was named Junior Fellow of
                    the GI (Gesellschaft für Informatik) in 2015.

                <p>
                    Since then, our research prototypes have grown into a commercial tool employed by professional software developers around the world every day. It implements both static and dynamic analyses for over 25 programming languages and runs in development, test and production environments of hundreds of companies. We bootstrapped our spin-off, CQSE GmbH, into a company of 30 employees (half of which hold a PhD in Software Engineering). All of us exclusively work on, or employ as part of our audit services, software quality analyses built upon this community’s research.

                    In this keynote, I want to share our key insights: experiences, surprises and anecdotes. I will cover hard lessons learned on how to have an impact in real-world projects, surprising results of seemingly trivial approaches, the role of software visualizations in marketing and our key learnings in transferring research from academia to practice.

                    Compilers and IDEs both analyze source code, yet compared to IDEs, compilers are easy.<br>
                    Compilers process source files a module at a time; IDEs have to load entire projects. Compilers exit after each run; IDEs run constantly, requiring responsible memory management and low CPU utilization. Compilers operate in batch; IDEs must constantly, incrementally re-analyze code after each change in the editor. Compilers stop when there is an error; IDEs are expected to be even more helpful when there are errors. Compilers create intermediate representations, soon throwing away source code; IDEs must always map back to source, respecting whitespaces and resolving references to the line and column number.<br>
                    The talk discusses these and other challenges, and how IDEs based on IntelliJ platform attack them.
