                <p>
                    Jan Bosch is professor of software engineering at Chalmers University Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. He is director of the Software Center (<a href="http://www.software-center.se" target="_blank">www.software-center.se</a>), a strategic partner-funded collaboration between 10 large European companies (including Ericsson, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Saab Defense, Jeppesen (Boeing)  and  Siemens) and five universities focused on software engineering excellence. Earlier, he worked as Vice President Engineering Process at Intuit Inc where he also led Intuit's Open Innovation efforts and headed the central mobile technologies team. Before Intuit, he was head of the Software and Application Technologies Laboratory at Nokia Research Center, Finland. Prior to joining Nokia, he headed the software engineering research group at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. He received a MSc degree from the University of Twente, The Netherlands, and a PhD degree from Lund University, Sweden. His research activities include evidence-based development, software architecture, innovation experiment systems, compositional software engineering, software ecosystems, software product families and software variability management. He is the author of several books including "Design and Use of Software Architectures: Adopting and Evolving a Product Line Approach" published by Pearson Education (Addison-Wesley & ACM Press) and “Speed, Data and Ecosystems: Excelling in a Software-Driven World” published by Taylor and Francis, editor of several books and volumes and author of a significant number of research articles. He is editor for Journal of Systems and Software as well as Science of Computer Programming, chaired several conferences as general and program chair, served on numerous program committees and organized countless workshops.<br>
                    In the startup space, Jan is chairman of the board of Fidesmo in Stockholm,  Auqtus and, until recently, Remente, in Gothenburg, Sweden. He serves on the advisory board of Assia Inc. in Redwood City, CA, Peltarion AB in Stockholm and Burt AB in Gothenburg, Sweden.

                <p>
                    We are living in the most exciting time in the history of mankind. The last century has seen unprecedented improvements in the quality of the human condition and technology is at the heart of this progress. Now we are experiencing an even bigger leap as we move towards a new level of digitalization and automation. Ranging from self-driving cars to factories without workers to societal infrastructure, every sensor and actuator is becoming connected and new applications that enable new opportunities are appearing daily. The fuel of this emerging connected, software-driven reality is software and the key challenge is to continuously deliver value to customers. The future of software engineering in this context is centered around a new, emerging digital business operating system consisting of four dimensions: Speed, Data, Ecosystems and Empowerment. The focus on speed is concerned with the constantly increasing rate of deploying new software in the field. This continuous integration and deployment is no longer only the purview of internet companies but is also increasingly deployed in embedded systems. Second, data is concerned with the vast amounts of information collected from systems deployed in the field and the behavior of the users of these systems. Software businesses need to significantly improve their ability to exploit the value present in that data. Third, ecosystems are concerned with the transition in many companies from doing everything in-house to strategic use of innovation partners and commodity providing partners. Finally, we need new ways of organizing work in this new, digital age. The keynote discusses these four main developments but focuses on the continuous software engineering. Also, the keynote provides numerous examples from the Nordic and international industry and predicts the next steps that industry and academia need to engage in to remain competitive.

                <p>
                    Dr. Elmar Juergens works both as a researcher and a founder. Elmar wrote
                    his PhD thesis on clone detection and is still active as a researcher in software
                    quality analysis. In 2009, he co-founded CQSE GmbH and since helps teams
                    in using analysis tools effectively and in implementing organizational change.<br>
                    Elmar sometimes talks at research conferences (e.g. ICSE, ICPC) and frequently
                    at industry events (50+ talks since 2012). Elmar was named Junior Fellow of
                    the GI (Gesellschaft für Informatik) in 2015.

                    I ran my first clone detection in an industrial context roughly a decade ago.
                    Fueled by both the amounts of problematic code it uncovered, and the (at least
                    partially) positive feedback from developers, our research group subsequently
                    focused on quality analyses to improve engineering practice.<br>
                    Since then, our research prototypes have grown into a commercial tool employed
                    by professional software developers around the world every day. We bootstrapped
                    our spin-off, CQSE GmbH, into a company of 30 employees (half of which hold a
                    PhD in Software Engineering). All of us exclusively work on, or employ, software
                    quality analyses built upon this communities research.<br>
                    In this keynote, I want to share key surprises and experiences we made. I will
                    cover hard lessons on how to have an impact in real-world projects, surprising
                    results of seemingly trivial approaches, the role of software visualizations in
                    marketing and our key learnings in research transfer from academia to practice.

                    Compilers and IDEs both analyze source code, yet compared to IDEs, compilers are easy.<br>
                    Compilers process source files a module at a time; IDEs have to load entire projects. Compilers exit after each run; IDEs run constantly, requiring responsible memory management and low CPU utilization. Compilers operate in batch; IDEs must constantly, incrementally re-analyze code after each change in the editor. Compilers stop when there is an error; IDEs are expected to be even more helpful when there are errors. Compilers create intermediate representations, soon throwing away source code; IDEs must always map back to source, respecting whitespaces and resolving references to the line and column number.<br>
                    The talk discusses these and other challenges, and how IDEs based on IntelliJ platform attack them.
